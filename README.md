## Hi there 👋

I’m Paula Jacqueline Bawuah — a curious front-end developer learning to build beautiful things, one line of code at a time.

## ✨ About Me

I’m locking in on front-end development — not just to perform, but to deeply *understand* how things work and why they work that way.  
I believe in showing up authentically, growing slowly, and learning with others — because no one does it alone.

## 🧩 What I’m working on

- 🌱 Learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
- 🛠️ Building small, real projects to sharpen my skills.
- 🔍 Asking questions and staying curious.

## ⚡ Fun fact

I’m the third woman in my family line born on a Wednesday — maybe that’s why I love fresh starts and midweek reflections. 🌿✨
